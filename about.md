User interface design (UID) or user interface engineering is the design of user interfaces for machines and software, such as computers, home appliances, mobile devices, and other electronic devices, with the focus on maximizing the user experience. The goal of user interface design is to make the user&#39;s interaction as simple and efficient as possible, in terms of accomplishing user goals (user-centered design).

User experience design (UXD or UED) is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product or application. User experience design encompasses traditional humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI) design,  and extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users. User experience is any aspect of a person&#39;s interaction with a given IT system, including the interface, graphics, industrial design, physical interaction, and the manual.
